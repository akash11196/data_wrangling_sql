Q1: Some of the facilities charge a fee to members, but some do not.
Please list the names of the facilities that do. 


SELECT name
FROM `Facilities`
WHERE membercost >0

Q2: How many facilities do not charge a fee to members? 

SELECT name
FROM `Facilities`
WHERE membercost =0

Q3: How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members,
where the fee is less than 20% of the facility's monthly maintenance cost?
Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the
facilities in question. 

SELECT facid,name,membercost,monthlymaintenance FROM `Facilities` WHERE membercost<0.2*monthlymaintenance

Q4: How can you retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5?
Write the query without using the OR operator. 

SELECT *
FROM `Facilities`
WHERE facid
IN ( 5, 1 )

Q5: How can you produce a list of facilities, with each labelled as
'cheap' or 'expensive', depending on if their monthly maintenance cost is
more than $100? Return the name and monthly maintenance of the facilities
in question. 

SELECT name,
monthlymaintenance,
CASE WHEN monthlymaintenance >100
THEN 'expensive'
ELSE 'cheap'
END AS is_cheap_or_expensive
FROM `Facilities`

Q6: You'd like to get the first and last name of the last member(s)
who signed up. Do not use the LIMIT clause for your solution. 

SELECT firstname,
surname
FROM `Members`
ORDER BY joindate DESC

Q7: How can you produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court?
Include in your output the name of the court, and the name of the member
formatted as a single column. Ensure no duplicate data, and order by
the member name. 

SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT( mem.firstname, ' ', mem.surname ) AS name
FROM Bookings book
JOIN Members mem ON mem.memid = book.memid
WHERE book.facid
IN ( 0, 1 )

Q8: How can you produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which
will cost the member (or guest) more than $30? Remember that guests have
different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and
the guest user's ID is always 0. Include in your output the name of the
facility, the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost.
Order by descending cost, and do not use any subqueries.

SELECT CONCAT( mem.firstname, ' ', mem.surname, ' using ', f.name ) AS description,
CASE WHEN book.memid =0
THEN book.slots * f.guestcost
ELSE book.slots * f.membercost
END AS cost
FROM Bookings book
JOIN Members mem ON mem.memid = book.memid
JOIN Facilities f ON f.facid = book.facid
WHERE book.starttime
BETWEEN '2012-09-14'
AND '2012-09-15'


Q10: Produce a list of facilities with a total revenue less than 1000.
The output of facility name and total revenue, sorted by revenue. Remember
that there's a different cost for guests and members!

SELECT SUM( c.cost ) AS revenue, c.facility
FROM (

SELECT f.name AS facility,
CASE WHEN book.memid =0
THEN book.slots * f.guestcost
ELSE book.slots * f.membercost
END AS cost
FROM Bookings book
JOIN Members mem ON mem.memid = book.memid
JOIN Facilities f ON f.facid = book.facid
WHERE book.starttime
BETWEEN '2012-09-14'
AND '2012-09-15'
) AS c
GROUP BY c.facility
